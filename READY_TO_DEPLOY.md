## 🚀 **Next Steps: Deploy Your Application**

### **Option 1: Follow the Interactive Checklist**

Open `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` and follow each step. It includes:
- ✅ Render backend deployment (Phase 1)
- ✅ Vercel frontend deployment (Phase 2)  
- ✅ Verification tests (Phase 3)
- ✅ Custom domain setup (Phase 4 - optional)

### **Option 2: Quick Start (If You're Experienced)**

1. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - New Web Service → Connect GitHub repo
   - Copy env vars from `ENV_VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md`
   - Deploy and get URL

2. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Import Project → Select repo
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to Render URL
   - Deploy and get URL

3. **Update Backend:**
   - Set Render `FRONTEND_URL` to Vercel URL
   - Redeploy backend

4. **Test Everything:**
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Test login, search, reviews, images

## 🎯 **Manual Steps Required** (I'll Guide You)

I **cannot** deploy automatically because these platforms require:

1. **Account Creation** - You need to sign up (free)
2. **GitHub Authorization** - You need to authorize access
3. **Service Creation** - You need to click "Create" buttons
4. **Env Var Entry** - You need to paste credentials

**But don't worry!** I'll guide you through each step.

## 💬 **Shall We Start Deployment NOW?**

I'll guide you step-by-step through:

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render (15 min)**
I'll tell you exactly what to click, where to paste env vars, and how to verify it works.

### **Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (10 min)**
I'll guide you through connecting your repo and configuring environment variables.

### **Step 3: Connect Them Together (5 min)**
I'll show you how to update the URLs so frontend and backend can communicate.

### **Step 4: Test Everything (10 min)**
I'll give you a test checklist to verify all features work.
