"""
Photo upload routes for Cloudflare R2 integration.
Provides presigned URLs for direct browser-to-R2 uploads.

What this enables:
- Users upload photos directly from browser to Cloudflare R2
- No files pass through our FastAPI server (saves bandwidth)
- Secure, time-limited upload permissions
- Global CDN distribution for fast photo access

Network flow:
1. Frontend requests upload URL from our API
2. Our API generates presigned URL with R2 credentials
3. Frontend uploads file directly to R2 using presigned URL
4. R2 validates signature and stores file globally
5. Frontend gets object_key to associate with reviews/properties

    Generate a presigned URL for direct photo upload to Cloudflare R2.
    
    What happens step by step:
    1. Validate user is authenticated (current_user dependency)
    2. Validate content_type is an allowed image format
    3. Generate unique object_key based on user_id and file_type
    4. Create cryptographically signed URL that R2 will accept
    5. Return URL + metadata to frontend
    
    Under the hood (presigned URL process):
    - Our R2 credentials sign a request with specific parameters:
      * HTTP method (PUT for upload)
      * Bucket name and object key (file path)
      * Content-Type requirement (security)
      * Expiration timestamp
    - R2 validates this signature when browser makes the request
    - Only requests matching exact parameters are accepted
    - This allows secure uploads without exposing our API keys
    
    Args:
        upload_request: Contains content_type and file_type
        current_user: Authenticated user from JWT token

    Returns:

    Generate a presigned URL for viewing an uploaded photo.
    
    Why we need this:
    - R2 bucket is private (not publicly accessible)
    - We control who can view which photos
    - Time-limited access for security
    - CDN optimization for global fast loading
    
    Under the hood (CDN flow):
    1. User clicks photo â†’ Frontend requests view URL from our API
    2. We generate presigned GET URL with R2 signature
    3. Browser requests photo using presigned URL
    4. Request hits Cloudflare edge server nearest to user
    5. If cached: Edge server serves photo immediately
    6. If not cached: Edge fetches from R2, caches, then serves
    7. Subsequent requests served from cache (very fast)
    
    Security considerations:
    - Object key path traversal protection
    - User authorization (future: check if user owns photo)
    - Time-limited URLs prevent unauthorized sharing
