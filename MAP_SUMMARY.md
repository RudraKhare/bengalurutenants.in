  🟡 Yellow = Good (3-4 stars)
  🔴 Red = Poor (<3 stars)
  🔵 Blue = No reviews
      ↓
Clicks on a marker
      ↓
Info window shows property details
      ↓
Clicks "View Details"
      ↓

  • Click "Use Current Location"
  • Click anywhere on map
      ↓
Reverse geocoding shows updated address
      ↓
User confirms location
      ↓
Property created with lat/lng
      ↓
User can now leave a review
```

**Component Used**: `MapPicker.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Auto-geocoding from address
- Draggable marker
- Current location detection

## 🔄 How Review System Uses Map

### **Current State:**

```
Property Creation → Map confirms location → Property saved with coords
                                                        ↓
                                            User can leave review on property
                                                        ↓
                                            Review linked to property (with location)
```

**Reviews DON'T currently:**
- ❌ Show map when writing review
- ❌ Verify user lived at property via location
- ❌ Display on property detail page map

**Reviews ARE linked to:**
- ✅ Property ID (which has lat/lng)
- ✅ User who wrote review
- ✅ Rating and comments

## 🚦 Current Status

### **✅ Fully Implemented:**
1. Property search with map visualization
2. Color-coded markers by rating
3. Distance-based filtering
4. Add property with auto-geocoding
5. Manual pin-drop for precise location
6. Reverse geocoding

- 80% cache hit rate
- Only 200 API calls needed
- Cost: **$1/month**
- **Savings: 80%**

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**Maps enhance property discovery and ensure data accuracy.**

Users can:
- **Find properties visually** with quality indicators (colored pins)
- **Add properties accurately** with auto-geocoding + manual adjustment
- **Filter by distance** from their location

Reviews are **linked to properties** that have accurate location data, making the platform more reliable and trustworthy.
