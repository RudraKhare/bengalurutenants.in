## 🏃 Quick Test (30 seconds)

### 1. Start Backend
```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Wait for: `Application startup complete`

### 2. Start Frontend (New Terminal)
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Wait for: `ready in XXms`

### 3. Test
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/property/search**
2. Press **F12** (open console)
3. Click **"1 km from current location"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Allow"** when browser asks for location
5. Watch console logs and see properties appear!

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Console (F12):
```
📍 Getting user location for 1km search...
✅ Location obtained: {lat: X, lng: Y}
🔍 Searching properties within 1km...
📦 Received X properties
```

### UI:
- ✅ "1 km" button turns blue
- ✅ Properties appear in center column
- ✅ Text shows "Using your current location"
- ✅ Properties sorted by distance (nearest first)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Location permission granted
- Console shows all 4 log messages
- Properties appear on screen
- Button highlighted in blue

## ❌ If It Doesn't Work
1. Check both terminals for errors
2. Verify http://localhost:8000/docs loads (backend running)
3. Verify http://localhost:3000 loads (frontend running)
4. Allow location in browser settings
5. Try larger radius (5km instead of 1km)
