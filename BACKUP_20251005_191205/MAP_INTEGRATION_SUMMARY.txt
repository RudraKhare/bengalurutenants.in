## What Was Done

### ✅ Added to Review Page:
1. **MapPicker component** import
2. **"Find Location on Map"** button
3. **Interactive map** with draggable marker
4. **Location confirmation** step
5. **Optional** - users can skip
6. **Coordinates passed to backend** (lat, lng)

## `/property/add` Analysis

### 🚨 Finding: It's REDUNDANT

**Evidence:**
- ❌ NOT linked anywhere in UI
- ❌ No navigation buttons to it
- ❌ Users can only reach it by manual URL
- ❌ Does LESS than `/review/add` (no review, no photos, no ratings)
- ✅ `/review/add` now has map too

### Recommendation:
**DELETE `/property/add`** - it serves no purpose

```powershell
Remove-Item frontend\src\app\property\add\page.tsx
```

**Unless** you have future plans for:
- Property owner listings (separate from reviews)
- Admin property management
- Property claiming system
