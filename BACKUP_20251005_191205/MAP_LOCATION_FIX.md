# Map Location Fix - Summary

## Issue
The map was showing a global view including North America because there was a property with coordinates outside India (Las Vegas, Nevada).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Deleted Property Outside India
- **Property ID**: 25
- **Address**: Counts Kustoms, Las Vegas Nevada
- **Coordinates**: Lat 36.171563, Lng -115.1391009
- **Associated Review**: ID 20 (also deleted)

### 2. Updated Default Map Center
Changed the default map center in `frontend/src/lib/googleMaps.ts`:
- **From**: Bengaluru (12.9716, 77.5946) with zoom 12
- **To**: Center of India (20.5937, 78.9629) with zoom 5

### 3. Current Properties Status
All remaining properties are now within India bounds:
- ✓ ID 27: Gokula Extension, Mathikere, Bengaluru
- ✓ ID 10: Koramangala 5th Block
- ✓ ID 11: Indiranagar 2nd Stage  
- ✓ ID 12: HSR Layout Sector 1
- ✓ ID 26: R.M.V. 2nd Stage, Bengaluru

## India Bounds (for reference)
The script uses these bounds to validate property locations:
- Latitude: 8.0 to 37.0
- Longitude: 68.0 to 97.0

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/lib/googleMaps.ts` - Updated default center and zoom
2. `backend/fix_coordinates.py` - Created utility script to find and remove properties outside India

## Next Steps
Refresh your browser to see the updated map. The map should now:
- Show only properties in Bengaluru when there are properties loaded
- Show India when there are no properties (default view)
- Not zoom out to include other continents
