# Review Verification Cache Fix

## Issue
After verifying a review in the admin panel, the verification badge (blue checkmark + green "Verified" text) was not appearing on the property detail pages immediately.

## Root Cause
The frontend was caching review data for 60 seconds using Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
```tsx
next: { revalidate: 60 } // Cache for 1 minute
```

This meant that even though the database was correctly updated with `is_verified=True`, the property detail page would show stale cached data for up to 60 seconds.

## Database Verification
Confirmed the backend verification endpoint works correctly:
```bash
Review 23 before: is_verified=False
# After admin verification...
Review 23 after commit: is_verified=True
```

## Solution
Changed the review fetching strategy from ISR caching to no-cache:

**File**: `frontend/src/app/property/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reviews?property_id=${id}`, {
  next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Cache for 1 minute
});
```

**After**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reviews?property_id=${id}`, {
  cache: 'no-store', // Don't cache reviews - always fetch fresh data
});
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Verified reviews appear immediately on property pages
- ✅ Admin panel verification is instantly visible to users
- ✅ No need to wait 60 seconds or hard refresh
- ✅ Property data still cached (60s) for performance - only reviews are always fresh

## Testing Steps
1. Go to `/admin/reviews`
2. Click "Verify" on any review
3. Visit that property's detail page (`/property/{id}`)
4. The review should immediately show:
   - Blue checkmark ✓ icon
   - Green "Verified" badge

## Technical Notes
- Review verification updates `reviews.is_verified = True` in database
- Backend returns `is_verified` field in ReviewOut schema
- Frontend displays dual badges: blue checkmark + green text for verified reviews
- Property information remains cached for performance (properties change less frequently)
- Reviews are now always fetched fresh to ensure verification status is current

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Short cache (5 seconds)**: Still has delay, not ideal for instant feedback
2. **Client-side revalidation**: Adds complexity, requires state management
3. **Webhook/WebSocket**: Overkill for this use case
4. **No-cache (chosen)**: Simple, immediate, acceptable performance impact

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Reviews are relatively lightweight data
- Each property page load will fetch fresh reviews from database
- Could optimize later with shorter cache (e.g., 5-10 seconds) if needed
- Property data still cached, reducing most expensive queries
