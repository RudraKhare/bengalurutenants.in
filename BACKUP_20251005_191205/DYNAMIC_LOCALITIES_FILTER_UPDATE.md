# Dynamic Localities Filter Update

## Overview
Updated the property search page to dynamically fetch and display localities based on the selected city, replacing the hardcoded Bengaluru localities with real-time data from the database.

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/app/property/search/page.tsx`

#### 1. Added New State Variables
```typescript
// Dynamic localities from API
const [cityLocalities, setCityLocalities] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [isLoadingLocalities, setIsLoadingLocalities] = useState(false);
```

#### 2. Added Locality Fetching Logic
```typescript
// Fetch localities when city changes
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchCityLocalities() {
    if (!selectedCity) return;
    
    setIsLoadingLocalities(true);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(buildApiUrl(API_ENDPOINTS.CITIES.LOCALITIES(selectedCity)));
      if (response.ok) {
        const localities = await response.json();
        const localityNames = localities.map((locality: any) => locality.name);
        setCityLocalities(localityNames);
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to fetch localities');
        setCityLocalities([]);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching localities:', error);
      setCityLocalities([]);
    } finally {
      setIsLoadingLocalities(false);
    }
  }
  
  fetchCityLocalities();
}, [selectedCity]);
```

#### 3. Updated Localities Filter UI
**Before:**
- Hardcoded `BengaluruLocalities` array
- Grouped by regions (Central, East, North, South, West)
- Only showed Bengaluru localities regardless of selected city

**After:**
- Fetches localities from database API
- Updates automatically when city changes
- Shows loading indicator while fetching
- Displays empty state message if no localities available
- Clean, flat list of all localities for the selected city

## Features

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Loading
- Localities are fetched from the database when the city changes
- Uses the same API endpoint as the review/add page: `/api/cities/{city}/localities`

### ‚úÖ Loading State
- Shows a spinner and "Loading localities..." message while fetching
- Prevents user interaction during load

### ‚úÖ Empty State
- Displays "No localities available for {city}" if no localities found
- Graceful handling of cities without locality data

### ‚úÖ Responsive UI
- Clean, simple list layout
- Hover effects for better UX
- Active state highlighting for selected locality
- Scrollable list for cities with many localities

## How It Works

### Data Flow
```
User selects city (e.g., "Mumbai")
         ‚Üì
selectedCity state updates
         ‚Üì
useEffect triggers
         ‚Üì
Fetches from: /api/cities/Mumbai/localities
         ‚Üì
Sets cityLocalities state
         ‚Üì
Localities filter updates with Mumbai localities
         ‚Üì
User can click locality to filter properties
```

### Integration Points
1. **City Selection**: When user changes city in the search dropdown
2. **API Endpoint**: `API_ENDPOINTS.CITIES.LOCALITIES(selectedCity)`
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with 50 cities and 2,762 real localities
4. **Locality Click**: Triggers `handleSelectLocality()` to filter properties

## User Experience

### Before
- User changes city to "Mumbai" in dropdown
- Localities filter still shows Bengaluru localities ‚ùå
- Confusing and incorrect data

### After
- User changes city to "Mumbai" in dropdown
- Localities filter automatically updates to show Mumbai localities ‚úì
- Loading indicator shown during fetch
- Clean, accurate locality list
- Click any locality to filter properties in that area

## Testing

To test the dynamic localities filter:

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to search page**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/property/search

4. **Test city switching**:
   - Select "Ahmedabad" from city dropdown ‚Üí See Ahmedabad localities
   - Select "Mumbai" ‚Üí See Mumbai localities
   - Select "Delhi" ‚Üí See Delhi localities
   - etc.

5. **Test locality filtering**:
   - Click any locality in the filter
   - Properties list should filter to that area
   - Selected locality highlighted in blue

## Database Requirements

Works with the current database setup:
- ‚úÖ 50 cities with localities
- ‚úÖ 2,762 total localities
- ‚úÖ API endpoint: `/api/cities/{city}/localities`

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Shows correct localities for each city
2. **Scalability**: Automatically works with new cities/localities added to database
3. **Consistency**: Uses same data source as review/add page
4. **Performance**: Fetches only when city changes, cached in state
5. **UX**: Loading states and empty states for better user experience

## Summary

The localities filter is now **fully dynamic** and updates based on the selected city, fetching real data from the database instead of using hardcoded Bengaluru localities. This provides an accurate and consistent experience across all cities with proper loading and empty states! üéâ
